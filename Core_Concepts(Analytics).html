    <h1>Core concept on cloud computing</h1>
<ul>
<p>
    Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet, rather than owning and managing their own physical infrastructure. Here are some core concepts in cloud computing:
</p>
    <h2>1.Service Models:</h2>
    
   <li> <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</h3> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking.</li>
   <li>   <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</h3> Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.</li>
      <li>    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS): </h3>Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install, manage, and maintain the software locally.</li>
          <h2>2.Deployment Models:</h2>
    
 <li>    <h3>Public Cloud:</h3> Owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and resources are made available to the general public or a large industry group.</li>
  <li>     <h3>Private Cloud: </h3>Operated solely for a single organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party, and it can be located on-premises or off-premises.</li>
   <li>       <h3>Hybrid Cloud:</h3> Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It provides greater flexibility and more deployment options.</li>
     <h2>3.Essential Characteristics:</h2>

  <li>     <h3>On-Demand Self-Service:</h3> Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider.</li>
 <li>   <h3>Broad Network Access:</h3> Services are accessible over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms.</li>
      <li>    <h3>Resource Pooling:</h3> Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</li>
      <li>    <h3>Rapid Elasticity:</h3> Resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned and released, allowing for quick scalability.</li>
      <li>    <h3>Measured Service:</h3> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging metering capabilities. Users pay for only the resources they consume.</li>
      <h2>4. Virtualization:</h2>
    
     <li>    <h3>Server Virtualization:</h3> Divides physical servers into multiple virtual servers, allowing efficient use of resources.</li>
       <li>    <h3>Storage Virtualization:</h3> Combines multiple network storage devices into a single storage unit.</li>
         <li>     <h3> Network Virtualization:</h3> Enables the creation of virtual networks, decoupled from the underlying physical network.</li>
         <h2>5.Orchestration and Automation:</h2>
    
        <li>   <h3>Orchestration</h3>: Coordination and management of multiple automated tasks to achieve a specific outcome or workflow.</li>
    <li>   <h3>Automation:</h3> The use of tools and scripts to perform tasks without human intervention, improving efficiency and reducing errors.</li>
        <h2>6.Security:</h2>
    
        </li>  <h3>Data Encryption: </h3>Protecting data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>    <h3>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</h3> Controlling access to resources by authenticating and authorizing users.</li>
            <li>    <h3> Compliance and Legal Issues:</h3> Ensuring that the cloud services comply with industry regulations and legal requirements.</li>
                <h2>7.Scalability and High Availability:</h2>
    
                <li>  <h3>Scalability:</h3> The ability of a system to handle increased workload by adding resources.</li>
                <li>   <h3>High Availability:</h3> Ensuring that a system is operational and accessible for a high percentage of the time.</li>
                      <h2>8.APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</h2>
    
    **APIs facilitate interaction between different software systems. In the context of cloud computing, they allow applications to access and utilize cloud services programmatically.
