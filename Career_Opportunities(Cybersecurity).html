  <p>Pursuing a career in cybersecurity means joining a booming industry where available jobs outnumber qualified candidates.
     According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of cybersecurity jobs is expected to increase by 32 percent between 2022 and 2032 [1]. 
     The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this demand. 
    As cybersecurity continues to grow in importance, more specialized roles are emerging. 
    Starting as a cybersecurity analyst creates opportunities to follow your interests within the world of information security and create a career path that’s right for you.
     Learn about five common career paths within this high-demand field. </p>

    <h3> 1. Engineering and architecture</h3>
      
        
            <li><p> As a security engineer, you’ll use your knowledge of threats and vulnerabilities to build and implement defense systems against a range of security concerns. 
            </li>
                <li><p>  Security engineering and architecture could be a good fit if you enjoy tinkering with technology and like to take a big picture approach to cybersecurity. You may advance to become a security architect, responsible for your organization's entire security infrastructure.

                    <li><p> Consider pursuing a master's degree or certification in analytics, data science, business analytics, or a related field for more specialized knowledge.</li>
    
                               
       
                        <h3> 2. Incident response</h3>
                
                       <li> <p> Despite a company’s best security efforts, security incidents still happen. The field of incident response involves the next steps after a security incident. As an incident responder, you’ll monitor your company’s network and work to fix vulnerabilities and minimize loss when breaches occur. 

                        Another area of incident response involves digital forensics and cybercrime. Digital forensic investigators work with law enforcement to retrieve data from digital devices and investigate cybercrimes. </li>

                        <h3>4. Consulting</h3>
                        
                        <li><p> Companies hire security consultants to test their computer and network systems for any vulnerabilities or security risks. In this role, you get to practice cybersecurity offense and defense by testing systems for vulnerabilities and making recommendations on how to strengthen those systems.

                          Consulting could be a good fit if you enjoy variety and want to make an impact by helping others manage their security.</li>
                            <li> <p> Skills to develop:


                              Penetration and vulnerability testing

                        <h3> 5. Testing and hacking</h3>
                        
                        <li><p> This field of cybersecurity goes by many names, offensive security, red team, white hat hacking, and ethical hacking among them. If you work in offensive security, you’ll take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. You’ll do this by playing the part of the intruder, trying to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. 
</li>
                        
                        
                        <li><p>
                          As a penetration tester, you’ll seek to identify and exploit system weaknesses to help companies build more secure systems. As an ethical hacker, you can try out even more attack vectors (like social engineering) to reveal security weaknesses.
                          
                          Testing and hacking could be a good fit if you want to outsmart the bad guys and get paid to (legally) hack into networks and computer systems.</li>
