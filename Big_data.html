    <h1>Introduction to Big data</h1>
    
<ul>    
   <h2> What is Big Data?</h2>
   <p> Big data is exactly what the name suggests, a “big” amount of data. Big Data means a data set that is large in terms of volume and is more complex. Because of the large volume and higher complexity of Big Data, traditional data processing software cannot handle it. Big Data simply means datasets containing a large amount of diverse data, both structured as well as     unstructured.<p> 
    
    <p> Big Data allows companies to address issues they are facing in their business, and solve these problems effectively using Big Data Analytics. Companies try to identify patterns and draw insights from this sea of data so that it can be acted upon to solve the problem(s) at hand.<p> 
    
        <p>  Although companies have been collecting a huge amount of data for decades, the concept of Big Data only gained popularity in the early-mid 2000s. Corporations realized the amount of data that was being collected on a daily basis, and the importance of using this data effectively.<p>

    <h2> 5Vs of Big Data</h2> 
    
   <li> Volume refers to the amount of data that is being collected. The data could be structured or unstructured.</li> 
    <li> Velocity refers to the rate at which data is coming in.</li> 
        <li> Variety refers to the different kinds of data (data types, formats, etc.) that is coming in for analysis.</li> 
            <li> Value refers to the usefulness of the collected data.</li> 
                <li> Veracity refers to the quality of data that is coming in from different sources.</li>
